Collection of digital circuit projects using JLS, including building up to an ALU.

# ALU
[ALU](https://github.com/GammaWyvern/Engineering/tree/main/alu) includes an ALU built from the ground up in JLS.
It holds most of my circuit work collected together. Below are image examples of some of my sub-circuits in the ALU.
