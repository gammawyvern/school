2. What output do you get?
  For me, it usually prints out main 0-19, and then happy 0-5.
  However, the order of print outs can be different every time you run it.
  The happy thread is being run in parallel with the main thread, so the 
  output depends on how they are scheudled to run in parallel by the os.

3. Change happy to print 10 times.
  We can just change threadArgument to 10.

4. Change thread return value
  It seems like we can return anything as long as it is a void*, or cast
  to a void*. Ideally this should probably be some status code or something,
  but we can return any void* value we want, just like a normal function.
